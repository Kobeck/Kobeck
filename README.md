- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Konstantin
- i'm interested in lots of stuff reaching from physics simulations and research to new and emerging technologies in finance.
- I'm currently learning Time Series Analysis and forecasting, especially the connection between phase transitions 
  in the Ising model and the long range memory of the autocovariance functions.
